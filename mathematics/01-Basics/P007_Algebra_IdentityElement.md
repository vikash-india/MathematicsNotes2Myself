# Description: Identity Element

## Concepts
### Identity Element
Let (S, ∗) is a set S with a binary operation ∗ on it. Then 
* An element e of S is called a left identity if

    ![Left Identity](../../code/latex/equations/images/P007_Algebra_IdentityElement_01_LeftIdentity.png)
* An element e of S is called a right identity if

    ![Right Identity](../../code/latex/equations/images/P007_Algebra_IdentityElement_02_RightIdentity.png)
* An element e of S is called a identity if e is both a left identity and a right identity.

### Identity Element for Addition
* The identity element for addition is 0 since 0 added to any number is the number itself. 
    ![Additive Identity](../../code/latex/equations/images/P007_Algebra_IdentityElement_03_AdditiveIdentity.png)
* The number 0 is called the ADDITIVE IDENTITY.

### Identity Element for Multiplication
* The identity element for multiplication is 1 since 1 multiplied to any number gives the number itself. 
    ![Multiplicative Identity](../../code/latex/equations/images/P007_Algebra_IdentityElement_04_MultiplicativeIdentity.png)
* The number 1 is called the MULTIPLICATIVE IDENTITY.
