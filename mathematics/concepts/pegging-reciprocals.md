# Description: Pegging Reciprocals

### Reciprocals from 1 to 30
- **Start**
    - A couple of weeks back I decided to commit reciprocals of of all the natural numbers upto 30. I just tried  
      remembering using the memory pegs technique.
    - The basic rule is to make weird association so that those association pops up as soon as you get those numbers.
- **1**
    - Reciprocal of 1 is trivial.
- **2, 4, ...**
    - Lets start with 2. Reciprocal of 2 is 50%. Half of that will yield 25% which reciprocal of 4. Another half and 
      you get 12.5 which reciprocal of 8. Once more halved and you get the reciprocal of 16 as 6.25.We wont halve it 
      any more as it will give us the reciprocal of 32 while our aim is just to remember the reciprocal upto 30.
- **3, 6, ...**
    - Now lets take up 3. Reciprocal is 33.33%. Keep dividing it by 2 to get further reciprocals on similar line. 
      Reciprocal of 6 is 16.67%. Reciprocal of 12 is 8.33%. Reciprocal of 24 is half of 8.33% which is 4.17%.
- **5, 10, ...**
    - Now take the 5 series. Reciprocal of 5 is 20%. Half of that and you get 10. Similarly reciprocal of 20 is 5%.
- **19 & 21**
    - 19 and 21 will have reciprocals .25 more than 5 and .25 less than 5. Reciprocal of 19 is 5.25 (5.26 
      actually) and 21 has 4.75(4.76 actually).
    - So we are already done with 14 numbers which is almost midway. 
- **7, 14, ...**
    - Lets peg 7 to memory. Next multiple of 7 is 14 and next multiple of 14 is 28. Put 14 and 28 to get the 
      reciprocal of 7 as 14.28 (Actually 14.29 but this approximation is good enough). Half of that and you get 
      7.14 as the reciprocal of 14.Halved once more and you have 3.57 as the reciprocal of 28.
- **9 & 11**
    - Lets club the reciprocal of 9 and 11 together. Just like reciprocal of 9 will have 11 in it ie 11.11, 
      reciprocal of 11 will have 2 9s in it ie 9.09.
- **18**
    - Once you have pegged 9 to the memory, 18 is not difficult to associate as its half of 9 ie 5.56.
- **22**
    - And similarly, half of 11 and you get the reciprocal of 22 as 4.55.
- **13**
    - 13 is considered an unlucky number and in order to have make it lucky, you need 7. Nope, single 7 wont do, 
      you would need two 7s. Hence the reciprocal will be 7.7 (Actually 7.69). Halve it to get 3.85 which is 
      reciprocal for 26.
- **15**
    - For 15, we will come back from 30. Reciprocal of 30 will be one-tenth of that of 3 which is 3.33. Double 
      of that will give us the reciprocal of 15 to be 6.67.
- **29 & 23**
    - Reciprocal of 29 and 23 have same digits-3, 4 and 5.29 will have 3.45 while reverse the first two digits 
      and get 4.35 as the reciprocal of 23.Another cue is that smaller the number, bigger the reciprocal.
- **25 & 27**
    - Now we are left with just 3 numbers 25, 27 and 17. Reciprocal of 25 is easy. if reciprocal of 4 is 25 
      then reciprocal of 25 is 4. And this holds true for every number. Hence by pegging reciprocals of 3 
      numbers we are actually committing reciprocals of approximately 60 numbers.
- **17**
    - I could not find any rule for 17 and hence associated it with the Local Bus running between Uttam Nagar to 
      Dhaula kuan in Delhi which was 588 and hence 5.88.
- **Finish**
    - The trick to recall any number is to recall the peg or the association first and then the reciprocal. I 
      tried these today after I learnt these technique a couple of years back and it seems to work. Try it out.
