# Description: Histogram

### Histogram
- A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability 
  distribution of a continuous variable (quantitative variable).
- A histogram is created by dividing the entire range of values into a series of intervalsâ€”and then count how many 
  values fall into each interval. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a 
  variable. The bins (intervals) must be adjacent, and are usually equal size.
- If the bins are of equal size, a rectangle is erected over the bin with height proportional to the frequency, the 
  number of cases in each bin. 
- The bins/intervals need not be of equal width; in that case, the erected rectangle has area proportional to the 
  frequency of cases in the bin. The vertical axis is not frequency but density: the number of cases per unit of the 
  variable on the horizontal axis. 

### Usage
- Histograms give a rough sense of the density of the underlying distribution of the data, and often for density 
  estimation: estimating the probability density function of the underlying variable. The total area of a histogram used 
  for probability density is always normalized to 1.
- The words used to describe the patterns in a histogram are: symmetric, skewed left or right, unimodal, bimodal or 
  multimodal.

### Note
- Histograms are sometimes confused with bar charts. A histogram is used for continuous data, where the bins represent 
  ranges of data, while a bar chart is a plot of categorical variables. Some authors recommend that bar charts have gaps 
  between the rectangles to clarify the distinction.
- A bar chart is for two-dimensional data while histogram is for one-dimensional data.
