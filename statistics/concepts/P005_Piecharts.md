# Description: Pie Charts

### Pie Charts
- A pie chart (or a circle chart) is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate 
  numerical proportion. 
- In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area), is proportional to the 
  quantity it represents. 
- Pizza Charts: In some very rare instances, pie charts can be found in square form. These kinds of pie charts are 
  sometimes referred to as "pizza charts", as the square resembles the shape of a pizza box.
- Donut Chart: A doughnut chart (also spelled donut) is a variant of the pie chart, with a blank center allowing for 
  additional information about the data as a whole to be included.
- Exploded Pie Chart: A chart with one or more sectors separated from the rest of the disk is known as an exploded pie 
  chart. This effect is used to either highlight a sector, or to highlight smaller segments of the chart with small 
  proportions.

### Usage
- It is generally difficult to compare different sections of a given pie chart, or to compare data across different pie 
  charts. Pie charts can be replaced in most cases by other plots such as the bar chart, box plot or dot plots. Hence
  statisticians generally regard pie charts as a poor method of displaying information, and they are uncommon in 
  scientific literature.
- If the goal is to compare a given category (a slice of the pie) with the total (the whole pie) in a single chart and 
  the multiple is close to 25 or 50 percent, then a pie chart can often be more effective than a bar graph.  

### Note
- None

### TODO
- Read other kind of pie charts like polar area diagram, ring chart/sunburst chart/multilevel pie chart, spie chart etc.
