# Description: Scatter Plots

### Scatter Plots
- A scatter plot is also called a scatter graph, scatter chart, scattergram, or scatter diagram.
- It is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables
  for a set of data.
- If the points are color-coded you can increase the number of displayed variables to three.
- The data is displayed as a collection of points, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the
  horizontal axis or X-axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis or Y-axis.
- If a parameter exists that is systematically incremented and/or decremented by the other, it is called the control 
  parameter or independent variable and is customarily plotted along the horizontal axis. The measured or dependent 
  variable is customarily plotted along the vertical axis. 
- Scatter charts can be built in the form of bubble, marker, or/and line charts.
- Scatterplot matrices: For a set of data variables (dimensions) X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ... , X<sub>k</sub>, the 
  scatter plot matrix shows all the pairwise scatter plots of the variables on a single view with multiple scatterplots 
  in a matrix format. 

### Usage
- A scatter plot can suggest various kinds of correlations between variables with a certain confidence interval.
- One of the most powerful aspects of a scatter plot, however, is its ability to show nonlinear relationships between 
  variables.
