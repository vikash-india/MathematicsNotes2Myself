# Description: Bar Charts

### Bar Charts
- A bar chart or bar graph is a chart that presents grouped data with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the 
  values that they represent. 
- The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. A vertical bar chart is sometimes called a column bar chart.
- One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a discrete value. 
- Grouped Bar Charts: Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one and are called grouped bar 
  graphs.
- Stacked Bar Charts: Some bar charts show the bars divided into subparts to show cumulative effect and are called 
  stacked bar graphs. 

### Usage
- Bar graphs/charts provide a visual presentation of categorical data. Categorical data is a grouping of data into 
  discrete groups, such as months of the year, age group, shoe sizes, and animals. These categories are usually 
  qualitative. In a column bar chart, the categories appear along the horizontal axis; the height of the bar corresponds 
  to the value of each category.
