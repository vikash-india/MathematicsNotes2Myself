# Description: Probabilty

### Probabilty
- For any event A
```
P(A) ∊ [0,1]
P(~A) = 1 - P(A)
```

### Independent Events
- If two events, A and B are independent then the joint probability is 
```
P(A and B) = P(A ∩ B) = P(A).P(B)
```

### Non Mutually Exclusive Events
- If the events are not mutually exclusive then
```
P(A or B) = P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
```

### Mutually Exclusive Events
- If two events are mutually exclusive then the probability of either occurring is
```
P(A or B) = P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) (since P(A ∩ B) = 0)
```

### Conditional Probabilty
- Conditional probability is the probability of some event A, given the occurrence of some other event B
```
P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)
Alternatively, P(A and B) = P(A ∩ B) = P(A | B) . P(B) = P(B | A) . P(A)
```
