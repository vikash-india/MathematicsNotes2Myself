# Description: Algebra - Face Value and Place Value

## Concepts
### Face Value
- The face value of a digit for any place in the given number is the value of the digit itself.
- Example: The face value of 2 in the number 7229 is always 2 irrespective of its place in the number.

### Place
- Each digit has a fixed position called its place. 
- Example: The place of left most 2 in 7229 is Hundreds while the place of right most 2 is Tens. 
- In a whole number, the digit farthest to the right is always in the ones place. The next farthest to the 
  right is in the tens place. The remaining digits continue to fill in the place values until there are no digits left.

### Place Value
- The place value of a digit in a number is the value it holds to be at the place in the number. 
- Place value of a digit = (Face value of the digit) Ã— (Value of the place).
- Example: The number 7229 has digit 7 with a place value of 7 thousands and 9 with a place value of 9 ones.
- The farther the digit is to the left, the greater its place value.

### Expanded Form 
- Expanded form is a way to write a number by adding the value of its digits. 
- Example: The number 7229 in expanded form is 7000 + 200 + 20 + 9.
- Reorganising Numbers
    - Any number can be reorganised in a number of ways. 
    - The number 692 can be expressed as follows
        - 6 Hundreds + 9 Tens + 2 Ones
        - 5 Hundreds + 19 Tens + 2 Ones
        - 4 Hundreds + 29 Tens + 2 Ones
        - 4 Hundreds + 28 Tens + 12 Ones

### Written Form
- The written form is a way to write numbers using only words. 
- Example: The number 7229 in written form is seven thousand, two hundred twenty-nine.
